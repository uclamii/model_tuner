The `model_tuner` library is a versatile and powerful tool designed to 
facilitate the training, tuning, and evaluation of machine learning models. 
It supports various functionalities such as handling imbalanced data, applying 
different scaling and imputation techniques, calibrating models, and conducting 
cross-validation. This library is particularly useful for hyperparameter tuning
and ensuring optimal performance across different metrics.
